# DoctoDom
It is a simple desktop application designed for medical offices. You can access as a doctor to see your scheduled appointments, or as a patient to schedule appointments and also see the appointments you must attend.

# Getting Started
You can easily download this project clicking the green button once you enter de repository, and run the project on you own machine.
The only thing you need to consider is that you’ll need to have the Database structure, and a Database created with a specific name (It is an academic project, don’t judge hahahah). In order to do this, you’ll have to open a folder named “DoctoDom”, then another one named “Scripts”, and you’ll have the Script to create your Database and the structure.

# Prerequisites
You need Visual Studio 2015 or the most recent version, also SQL Server Management Studio.
